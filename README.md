# 🧬 The Stellar Organism

**A Self-Evolving, Autonomous dApp Generator on the Stellar Network.**

The Stellar Organism is an experimental AI agent that lives in a GitHub repository. Driven by a cron job and powered by a dual-model Gemini AI "brain," the organism wakes up periodically to conceptualize, write, and deploy entirely new decentralized applications (dApps) using the Stellar blockchain.

There is no human intervention in the generation process. The organism invents the concept, writes the Python code, integrates the Freighter wallet via JavaScript, styles the UI, and publishes it to its own Streamlit App Store.

## 🧠 The Hybrid Brain Architecture

The Organism operates using a two-step AI pipeline designed to balance wild creativity with strict syntactical stability.

### 1. The Architect (Gemini 2.0 Flash)

The creative engine. The Architect is fed a random subset of raw Stellar operations (e.g., `ChangeTrust`, `ManageData`, `ClaimClaimableBalance`) and is instructed to act as an "avant-garde software creator."

* **Variety Engine:** It reads the history of previously generated apps to ensure it never repeats the same theme twice.
* **Output:** It generates a JSON specification containing a metaphorical name, a one-sentence pitch, and a specific visual style (e.g., "Cyberpunk", "Mystical/Arcane", "Minimalist").

### 2. The Engineer (Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental)

The strict builder. Streamlit and the Stellar SDK are unforgiving, so the Engineer takes the Architect's JSON spec and translates it into functional Python code.

* **The Mandates:** The Engineer is bound by a strict set of 10+ prompt-engineered "Mandates" (a syntactical vaccine). These mandates prevent AI hallucinations by forcing strict import rules, specific SDK syntax, correct Freighter JS-to-Python communication, and automated fallback logic for secret keys.
* **Output:** A raw `.py` file placed directly into the `pages/` directory.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Network:** Stellar Testnet
* **Frontend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (Multi-Page App)
* **Wallet Integration:** [Freighter Wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) (Injected via `st.components.v1.html`)
* **Blockchain SDK:** Stellar Python SDK
* **AI Models:** Google Generative AI (`gemini-2.0-flash` & `gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05`)
* **Automation:** GitHub Actions

## 🪐 Features

* **Autonomous Evolution:** Triggered via GitHub Actions, `organism.py` runs on a schedule to continually expand its library of dApps.
* **Dynamic App Store UI:** The `Home.py` file acts as an Apple-style App Store. It reads the `pages/` directory on the fly, strips formatting, generates deterministic gradient icons via MD5 hashing, and displays clickable app cards.
* **Zero-Friction Demo Mode:** Apps are generated with logic to detect if standard `st.secrets` are missing. If so, they automatically generate ephemeral Stellar keypairs and fund them via Friendbot so observers can test the dApp immediately.
* **Full Freighter Support:** Despite Streamlit's stateless Python nature, the organism writes custom JavaScript bridges to allow users to connect their Freighter browser extensions and sign XDR transactions seamlessly.

## 🛠️ Running Your Own Organism

Want to fork the organism and let it evolve on your own machine?

### 1. Setup Environment

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stellar-organism.git
cd stellar-organism
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 2. Inject the DNA (API Key)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...your_api_key_here"

```

### 3. Spawn a New App

Run the organism script to trigger a generation cycle. You will see the Architect conceive an idea, and the Engineer build it.

```bash
python organism.py

```

*If successful, a new `00X_app_name.py` file will appear in the `pages/` folder.*

### 4. View the App Store

Boot up the Streamlit interface to explore the organism's creations:

```bash
streamlit run Home.py

```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is highly experimental. The code generated by the Organism is entirely written by AI. While the "Mandates" attempt to enforce best practices, the resulting applications are meant for the **Stellar Testnet only**. Do not use real funds, and do not input mainnet secret keys into the generated applications.

The Organism is a demonstration of AI autonomy, prompt engineering, and the flexibility of the Stellar network.
